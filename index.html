        <h1>About me Page</h1>
        <h2> A lil bit about me: </h2>
        <br>
        <p>My name is Johnny and I'm 28 years old. prior to doing this course, I worked in an IT helpdesk
             for 8 months and beforethat, most of my career has been in customer services, mainly working
              for local governments.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Although it's a bit embarrassing to admit, I would have to say my main hobby is video games.
             I absolutely love loads of different kinds of games from FPS & RPGs to MOBAS and RTS games though
            I will say that fantasy/scifi RPGs are my weakness, especially if they're open world and you can
            completely ignore the main quest!  </p>
            <br>
        <p> Currently, my top 10 most played games on my steam library are as follows:</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Dota 2 - this is first by a long margin! And if you're thinking "you've played that game
                a lot so you must be good right?" sadly you would be very wrong! </li>
            <li>Total War: Warhammer 2 & 3</li>
            <li>Dead By Daylight</li>
            <li>Stellaris</li>
            <li>Fallout: New Vegas - This is also a game where I have every steam achievement!</li>
            <li>Crusader Kings 3</li>
            <li>Kenshi</li>
            <li>Baldurs Gate 1 & 2</li>
            <li>elden ring</li>
            <li>Sekiro - Another game where I have all the achievements!</li>
        </ol>
